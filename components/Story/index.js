          It was a complete year learning about computers, all about them. From the transistors inside all the
          components to the software.
        </ParagraphText>
        <ParagraphText>
          It was at that moment that I realized that I had this tech soul where I needed to dig into the construction of
          the thing I was in front of. The distinct curiosity, the passion about the architecture and how and why does
          that work.

          So when I was 13 I started high school at Brigadier Gral. Coornelio Saavedra 17 D.E. 13. It was a
          tech-oriented school where I learned about electronics and general knowledge. It was a great experience in
          which I learned about teamwork, electricity, chemistry, electronic systems, and many more things.
        </ParagraphText>
        <ParagraphText>
          During my course in school, when I was 16 exactly I started digging into the coding world, I started partly
          because of the school where we practiced coding with an embedded electronic board called{' '}
          <TextLink href='https://www.arduino.cc'>Arduino</TextLink>, and also because I have a relative that advised me
          to get into this wonderful world. So with my almost 17 years old and all my enthusiasm I started the travel to
          become a web developer.
        </ParagraphText>
        <ParagraphText>
          And here I am 2 years later having learned many technologies, architectures, and people I can be sure of some
          things:
        </ParagraphText>
        <ul className={styles.list}>
          <li>
            <TextListItem>I feel great about joining this awesome world and I don't regret a thing.</TextListItem>
          </li>
          <li>
            <TextListItem>I now know great people that are passionate as well.</TextListItem>
          </li>
          <li>
            <TextListItem>And also, as Socrates said, I know that I know nothing.</TextListItem>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
