I am Tzivi Gelstein and I was born at <TextLink href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Beerseba,+Israel/@31.2614223,34.7208468,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x15026640029f8777:0x8dee8012deb5dd8!8m2!3d31.252973!4d34.791462?shorturl=1">BÃ©er Sheva, Israel.</TextLink> I grew up there until the age of 3, then my family and I moved back to Argentina where we live happily.

Iâ€™ve been always a tech passionate, since I was young I enjoyed using the computer, gaming mainly <TextEmoji>ðŸ˜…</TextEmoji>. But for me, the machine I had in front was in fact a whole mystery.

A short time later, I started digging into a computer building, _What is a processor? What is a Motherboard? Why my data held on my hard disk?_ These are the questions I had that nobody could answer. Nobody but the internet.

It was a complete year learning about computers, all about them. From the transistors inside all the components to the software.

It was at that moment that I realized that I had this tech soul where I needed to dig into the construction of the thing I was in front of. The distinct curiosity, the passion about the architecture and how and why does that work.

So when I was 13 I started high school at Brigadier Gral. Coornelio Saavedra 17 D.E. 13. It was a tech-oriented school where I learned about electronics and general knowledge. It was a great experience in which I learned about teamwork, electricity, chemistry, electronic systems, and many more things.

During my course in school, when I was 16 exactly I started digging into the coding world, I started partly because of the school where we practiced coding with an embedded electronic board called <TextLink href="https://www.arduino.cc">Arduino</TextLink>, and also because I have a relative that advised me to get into this wonderful world. So with my almost 17 years old and all my enthusiasm I started the travel to become a web developer.

And here I am 2 years later having learned many technologies, architectures, and people I can be sure of some things:

- <TextListItem>I feel great about joining this awesome world and I don't regret a thing.</TextListItem>

- <TextListItem>I now know great people that are passionate as well.</TextListItem>

- <TextListItem>And also, as Socrates said, I know that I know nothing.</TextListItem>
