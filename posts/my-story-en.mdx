I'm Tzivi Gelstein. I was born in the bustling city of <TextLink href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Beerseba,+Israel/@31.2614223,34.7208468,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x15026640029f8777:0x8dee8012deb5dd8!8m2!3d31.252973!4d34.791462?shorturl=1">Béer Sheva, Israel.</TextLink> I spent my early years there before my family and I relocated to Argentina.

I've always had a passion for technology. As a child I was drawn to computers and gaming. But to me, the computers before me were a complete mystery. I was curious about how they worked and what was inside of them, but no one around me seemed to know the answers. So, I turned to the internet. I spent an entire year learning everything I could about computers – from the transistors inside the components to the software that ran on them.

It was during this time that I realized I had a true love for technology and a deep desire to understand their inner workings. I wanted to know how they were built and why they worked the way they did.

I spent a full year learning about computers. From the transistors to the software.

At 13 I started high school. It was a tech-oriented school that taught me about electronics, chemistry, and teamwork. A great experience that opened my eyes to many different fields and sparked my curiosity even further.

At the age of 16, I decided to dive into the world of coding. Partly inspired by my school's focus on technology and partly by people who encouraged me to pursue this path. I eagerly began my journey to become a developer.

Three years later, I've learned a lot about various technologies, architectures, and people. And I can confidently say that I have no regrets about joining this incredible field. I've met amazing people who share my passion. I am excited to continue on this journey and see where it takes me.
